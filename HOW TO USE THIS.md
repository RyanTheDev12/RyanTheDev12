Using this for your own profile is **easy!**


- Simply take a template of the repository
- Rename the new repo it created on your GitHub account to GitHub username

So, the name of my repository is "RyanTheDev12" because my GitHub username is "RyanTheDev12"


So, simply template it, and rename it, then edit the Markdown file called "README.md" to your liking, and to match your info / personality.

Happy Coding :]
